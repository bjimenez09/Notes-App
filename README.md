# Note App

## Description

For this project we were given a starter code to create an Note Taker application that can be used to write and save notes. The application will run on Heroku CLI using node.js, express.js, Javascript, creating rest endpoints, and utilizing GET, POST, and DELETE requests, as well as modular routing.
